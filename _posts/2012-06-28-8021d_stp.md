# BPDUs – Bridge Protocol Data Units
BPDUs are sent as 802.3 frames with a source address equal to the MAC address of the sending switch port and with a destination address of `01:80:C2:00:00:00`. The LLC header has the DSAP and SSAP fields set to 0x42.

- **Protocol ID** is set to `0x0000` (IEEE 802.1d).
- The **version** can be one of `0x00` (802.1d STP), `0x02` (802.1w – RSTP) and `0x03` (802.1s – MSTP).
- The **Type** field indicates wether this BPDU is a Config BPDU(`0x00`) or a TCN – Topology Change Notification BPDU (`0x80`).
- Bit 1 in the **Flags** field signals a TCN BPDU, while Bit 8 in the same field signals a TC ACK.
- Timer fields like **Message Age**, **Max Age**, **Hello Time** and **Forward Delay** are stored in units of 1/256 sec.

# How a Bridge ID is unique in a VLAN
To find out the Base Mac Address used by STP, you can use the following command:
```
Sw# show version | i Mac
```
Also, to see Spanning Tree parameters used for each vlan, you can use:
```
Sw# show spanning-tree bridge
